With this use, the location where the bash environment is installed in the system is automatically found and the script file is run through this environment. If you ask why this is necessary; In exceptional cases, the bash environment may not be in the <strong> / bin / bash </strong> position, which is the position we first specified. As a matter of fact, we have seen this situation in the file <strong><em>/etc/shells</em> </strong>. In such cases, <code> env </code> tool takes care of determining where the bash environment where our script file will be run is installed on the system. The <code> env </code> tool can easily find the location where the bash environment is installed on the system by querying the environment variables. </p> <p id = "c6b22b15-d545-426f-b9cc-428c8460c6ce" class = ""> Okay but < code> env < Is the / code> command under <em><strong>/usr/bin/</strong></em> <em> </em> on all systems? So the location of the <code> env </code> command does not change from system to system? No changes except in rare cases, because many script files specify the environment to be run with this method. Systems also keep the file of the env tool under the directory <em><strong>/usr/bin/</strong></em> <strong> </strong>. <strong> </strong> Observing this situation On behalf of you, you can try to confirm this situation through different systems. It is located at <em> <strong> / usr / bin / env </strong> </em> on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, MacOS, SUSE, RHEL, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris .. </p> <p id = " With the command, we can open the required environment. Because the Python working environment may be located in different locations on different systems and we also specifically inform that the file should work with the Python environment, thanks to <code> env </code>. Here, we make use of the <code> env </code> command to automatically find and run its own working environment on all systems of the vehicle we have written. In this way, if the bash environment is installed on the system, the <code> env </code> command will find the bash environment and run it. In other words, this usage is essential for the script files we have written to be run in common on all Linux systems, in other words our script file to be a portable file. By default, the system tries to run the script file over the existing shell. So if the shell used on your current system is bash, "<strong> #! / Usr / bin / env bash </strong>" Even if you don't add the statement to your script file, your script will run fine since the default shell is bash in the system. However, in order for the script file you have written to run correctly on other systems, & quot; <strong> #! / usr / bin / env bash </strong> & quot; namely & quot; shebang & quot; It is extremely important that you add the phrase to the beginning of your script file. Although most Linux distributions use the bash shell by default, in exceptional cases, it may be that different shells are used by default. For example, the script file you wrote for bash, When run on a system with the default working environment zsh, if there is no shebang statement at the beginning that indicates that this script file is suitable for running in bash environment, it will not work correctly. Because when the system opens the file, it will see that a particular environment is not specified and will try to run it via the default shell (shell zsh in our example). </p> <p id = "11b5f90f-23bf-4ec4-986d-3ae593effa38" class = ""> adding it to the beginning, a little "clean code" "regular (clean) code" called " It is part of the writing culture.

In fact, our script file can eventually work without the "<strong> sh" </strong> extension, as long as it has the proper working environment. However, it is important to mention "<strong> sh" </strong> at the end of the files to help us understand which files are script files in the future. Because the extension of the file does not matter when running the file in Linux systems. If the environment required to run the related file is loaded in the system, the file is run. However, adding such extensions contributes to the classification so that the file can be easily found later. </p> <p id = "76d9023b-af0d-4e68-b561-36ae86b83e6e" class = ""> Imagine a folder with hundreds of files and a situation where none of the files in that folder have distinctive extensions.
